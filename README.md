# Heart-Stroke-Prediction
# Summary:
* Predicted heart stroke with an accuracy of 99.43% using Random Forest classifier, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, XGBoost classifier models, with Random Forest classifier having highest accuracy
* Implemented GridSearch and Stack ensemble of the above models to achieve higher accuracy of 99.53% and f1 score of 0.99, which performed better using single models for prediction
* Implemented pre-processing methods such as handling missing values, data deduplication, class balancing methods such as SMOTE, EDA, outlier removal to improve efficiency by 20%
# Uses:
* Training model to predict heart stroke on the patient data with high accuracy provides us useful model to identify high risk patient who has high chance of stroke and can be saved.
